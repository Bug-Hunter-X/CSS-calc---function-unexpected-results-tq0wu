The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because the browser can't subtract a unitless number from a percentage.
